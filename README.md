### Project Title: health insurance analysis

### Project Overview
This Health Insurance Data Analysis project aims to generate insights into billing patterns, hospital stays, and patient demographics over the past year. By analyzing various parameters within the dataset, we seek to uncover trends, optimize decision-making, and tell compelling data-driven stories that can inform healthcare financing policies and insurance strategies.

### Data Sources
The primary dataset used in this analysis is Health_Insurance_Data.csv, an open-source dataset that can be accessed from online repositories such as Kaggle, FRED, or similar data sources.

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com) 
  1. For Data Cleaning
	2. For Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  3. For Data Visualization (Pivot Tables & Charts)
- GitHub for Portfolio Building

 ### Data Cleaning and Preparation
 During the initial phase of data processing, the following steps were taken:
  1.	Data Loading and Inspection – Reviewing the dataset structure and identifying key variables.
  2.	Handling Missing Values – Addressing gaps in the dataset to ensure completeness.
  3.	Data Cleaning and Formatting – Standardizing data to enhance accuracy in analysis.

 ### Exploratory Data Analysis
 The analysis aimed to answer critical questions, such as:
- What is the billing trend across different patient demographics?
- How does hospital length of stay vary by diagnosis?
- Which diseases or conditions contribute the most to insurance claims?
- How do billing amounts compare across gender groups?

Through pivot tables and visual dashboards, we gained insights that can drive better policy decisions and improve healthcare cost efficiency.

### Data Analysis
This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during your analysis; 

### Data Visualisation





This is where I documented my first project while learning Data Analysis with Incubator Hub
